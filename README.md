## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
The Early Detection Model for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) offers a non-invasive and accessible diagnostic tool, significantly enhancing early detection capabilities for healthcare providers. By analyzing routine blood test data, this project enables faster, cost-effective, and proactive CML diagnosis, particularly benefiting low-resource settings. The model's integration of machine learning for disease prediction demonstrates the potential to improve patient outcomes and support more timely, life-saving interventions.
This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
